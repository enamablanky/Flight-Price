## **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict flight ticket prices based on various factors such as departure and arrival times, airline, route, and other key attributes. Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes historical flight data to identify patterns and trends, enabling better price forecasting.

## **Motivation**
With fluctuating airline ticket prices, travelers and businesses can benefit from tools that help predict costs in advance. This project provides insights into factors influencing prices and builds predictive models to assist in price estimation.
